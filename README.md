# Mobile Probe Interface 

The Mobile Probe Interface extends the [RI implementation] (https://fp7mplane.github.io/protocol-ri) to support the data collected for the mobile probe.

More specifically, the Interface sits on top of the MongoDB (where the data are stored) and exports its collections as capabilities.
